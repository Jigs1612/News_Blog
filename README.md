Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen(max-width:550) size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle the mobile menu

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.
